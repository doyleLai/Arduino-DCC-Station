# Arduino-DCC-Station
This project adapted Michael Blank's [program code](http://www.oscale.net/en/simpledcc) for signal generation. The original program supports one decoder only. This program supports up to 9 decoders and provides command controls on the serial port.

The Arduino program generates two opposite DCC signals. When one signal goes HIGH, the other goes LOW, and vice versa. That means you can connect them to an H-bridge circuit to boost up the signal to power the track and locomotives.

## Board Compatibility
The program uses the hardware timer and interrupts to achieve the precise pulse width generations of the DCC signal. Not all Arduino boards are supported.

Supported boards:
- Arduino UNO (Other ATmega328p based boards may be supported)
- Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2 (Other ATmega4809 based boards may be supported)

## Wiring
Connect pin 11 and pin 12 on Arduino to the two input pins of the H-bridge. Connect the two output pins of the H-bridge to the track. Be sure you use an H-bridge to deliver the large current flow used by locomotives. Do not connect Arduino pins to the track and locomotives directly. 

## Installation
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open the folder "Arduino-DCC-Station" with Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the program to your Arduino board.
4. Connect the Arduino to the H-bridge circuit and the track.
5. Open Serial Monitor and send control messages (see below) to control your locos. 

## Control Messages
The program reads control messages from the USB serial port and generates corresponding DCC signals. The states of locomotives, including the direction, speed step and function ON/OFFs of F0-F20 (F0 refers to headlight), are stored in the SRAM so the system will output DCC messages to all locomotives periodically without the need of repetitive control messages.

### Message format
Each message is enclosed by "<>" and has the following format:
```
Type (1 byte), Address (1 byte), Payload
```
### Type S - Speed control
```
<SADVVV>
```
This type of message controls the direction and speed step of a locomotive.
The payload consists of 1 byte of direction D [0 (backward),1 (forward)], followed by 3 bytes of 128 speed step VVV [000-127].

#### Example
Sets the speed of address 3 decoder to forward direction and speed step 5.
```
<S31005>
```
* Type: S
* Address (A): 3
* Payload
  * Direction (D): 1
  * Speed Step (VVV): 005

### Type F - Function control
```
<FAUUE>
```
The payload consists of 2 bytes of function index F0-F20 UU [00-20], followed by 1 byte of on/off E [1,0].
* F0 is the function control of the headlight.

#### Example
Turns ON the F2 of address 3 decoder.
```
<F3021>
```
* Type: F
* Address (A): 3
* Payload
  * Function (UU): 02
  * ON/OFF (E): 1
