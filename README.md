# Arduino-DCC-Station
This project is adapted from Michael Blank's work. The original program supports one decoder only. This program aims to support multiple decoders.

## Hardware Configuration
You need an H-bridge motor driver to deliver a large current flow used by locomotives. Connect Ardunio's pin 11 and 12 to the two input pins of your H-bridge. Connect the two output pins of the H-bridge to the rails.

This program was tested in Arduino UNO Rev3.

If you use a non-isolated oscilloscope to measure the Arduino or the motor driver's output pulses, attach the probe tip only. Never connect the ground lead of a non-isolated oscilloscope to any signal pin.

## Control Messages
The program continuously reads control messages from the USB serial port and generates corresponding DCC signals. The states of locomotives, including the direction, speed step and function ON/OFFs of F0-F20 (F0 refers to headlight), are stored in the SRAM so the system can re-generate DCC messages for all locomotives periodically without the need of repeating control messages.

### Message format
Each message is enclosed by "<>" and has the following format:
```
Type (1 byte), Address (1 byte), Payload
```
#### Type S - Speed control
```
<SADVVV>
```
This type of message controls the direction and speed step of a locomotive.
The payload is 1 byte of direction D [0 (backward),1 (forward)], followed by 3-byte fixed size value of 128 speed step VVV [000-128].

#### Type F - Function control
```
<FAUUE>
```
The payload is a 2-byte fixed size value of the index of function F0-F20 UU [00-20], followed by 1 byte value of on/off E [1,0].
* F0 is the control of the headlight.

#### Example 1:
The following message sets the speed of address 3 decoder to forward direction and speed steps 5.
```
<S31005>
```
* Type (T): S
* Address (A): 3
* Direction (D): 1
* Speed Step (VVV): 005

#### Example 2:
The following message turns ON the F2 of address 3 decoder.
```
<F3021>
```
* Type (T): F
* Address (A): 3
* Function (UU): 02
* ON/OFF (O): 1

## How to use it
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open the folder "Arduino-DCC-Station" with Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the program to your board.
4. Wire the hardware. Make sure you have used an external power source to power the motor driver.
5. Connect to the USB Serial port of the Arduino.
6. Send control messages and enjoy!
